# caesarscipher
Caesar Cipher is a form of message encoding and decoding. Caesar ciphers employ a substitution approach in which the alphabetic characters are moved in a predetermined number of times to produce an encoding alphabet. An A would be encoded as a B in a Caesar cipher with a one shift, a M as an N, a Z as an A, and so on.  

Here is how the program works. The typical program of caesar's cipher will allow user to choose how many times the letter are shifted however this program I created only shift letter once.

As you can see, the program has four buttons. The encrypt, decrypt, clear and copy to clipboard.

Let's input 'Happy New Year!' and we will click the button encrypt, to encrypt the letters.

As a result the first letter, the H shifted into the next letter which is the G. The second letter, the a has shifted once and was replaced by the last letter in alphabet which is z until you reach the very last letter of our input, and so on and so forth.
