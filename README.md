# caesarscipher
This program I created is a very simple caesar cipher, a form of message encoding and decoding. Caesar ciphers employ a substitution approach in which the alphabetic characters are moved in a predetermined number of times to produce an encoding alphabet. An A would be encoded as a B in a Caesar cipher with a 1 shift, a M as an N, a Z as an A, and so on. This program I created only shift letter once and has a simple straightforward feature that is enough for school project.
